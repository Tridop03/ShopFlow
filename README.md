## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To enable the intelligent features (Search & Recommendations), you must have a valid Google Gemini API Key.

### Configuration
The application expects the following environment variable to be available:
- `process.env.API_KEY`: Your Google Gemini API Key.

### Installation & Usage
Since this project uses modern ES6 modules via an import map in `index.html`, no heavy build step is required for development.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure your local environment provides the `API_KEY`.
3. Open `index.html` via a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
ShopFlow adheres to **Minimalist Functionalism**. We believe that e-commerce should be invisible—getting the user from discovery to checkout with zero friction and maximum delight. This is achieved through high-contrast typography (Inter font), spacious layouts, and a "Night & Day" color palette optimized for all lighting conditions.
